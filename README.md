## Building Your Own Version
This app can be easily edited for use with any collection of data sets with [Geoservices](http://geoservices.github.io/) REST APIs that use [point geometry objects](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/common-data-types/geometry-objects.htm). Many cities and organizations make their open data sets available through Geoservices, and a full collection of over 180,000 data sets is available on [ArcGIS Hub](https://hub.arcgis.com/search?collection=Dataset).

To create your own version of this app, simply [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the repository, [rename](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/renaming-a-repository) if desired, and edit the [`data_source_information.R`](https://github.com/mvanbommel/SacOpenData/blob/master/data_source_information.R) script according to the instructions in the comments.

In order to run the app, you will need to [install R](https://cran.r-project.org/) ([installing RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) is also recommended). When you run the app for the first time, run the commands:
```
source("install_package.R")
install_packages()
```
to ensure all necessary packages are loaded. 

You can then run the app using the 
```
shiny::runApp()
```
command. If you are unfamiliar with Shiny, there are [tutorials](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) available.

To learn more about sharing or publishing your app, see the [Share Your Apps](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson7/) tutorial.
